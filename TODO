- Call from notifier to upgrader
currently the call from notifier to upgrader is through subprocess.
This seems "clumsy", maybe use upgrader as a module? -> takes much memory
subprocess gives the option to call another upgrade programm.
maybe start in another thread?

- Implement aptdaemon.client.transaction.set_terminal()
- Implement aptdaemon.client.transaction.remove_obsoleted_depends

- Move to libqapt (qt) instead of aptdaemon for better qt integration.
