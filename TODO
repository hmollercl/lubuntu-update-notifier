-call from notifier to upgrader
currently the call from notifier to upgrader is through subprocess.
This seems "clumsy", maybe use upgrader as a module? -> takes much memory
subprocess gives the option to call another upgrade programm.
maybe start in another thread?

-move to qapt (libqapt) instead of aptdaemon for better qt integration.
